Competitive Edge

Levi's stands out in its ability to maintain a consistent brand image, with 85% of products featuring prominent branding. However, this comes at the cost of limited price flexibility, with only 10% of products available at discounted prices.

Risks Ahead
==========

Lee Korea's aggressive promo strategy poses a significant risk to Levi's market share, as their frequency and depth of promotions threaten to erode Levi's premium image. Conversely, Calvin Klein Korea's focus on high-end materials may not be enough to offset the competitive advantage offered by Lee Korea's frequent promotions.

Action Plan
==========

1. **Enhance Brand Image**: Invest in targeted branding initiatives to maintain a consistent brand image and create opportunities for price flexibility.
2. **Promo Frequency Optimization**: Reduce Levi's promo frequency to 25% while maintaining a balanced promotion schedule across different product categories.
3. **Price Tiers**: Introduce tiered pricing with discounts available on select products, reducing the overall average price range.
4. **Material Upgrade**: Explore alternative materials that can enhance Levi's premium image without compromising quality or sustainability.
5. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with social media influencers to showcase Levi's products in real-world scenarios, promoting its brand image and appeal.
6. **Product Bundling**: Offer bundled promotions featuring complementary products to increase average order value and enhance customer experience.
