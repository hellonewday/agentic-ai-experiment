#### Executive Summary
Levi's denim promotion campaigns face stiff competition from Lee Korea and Calvin Klein Korea. Our analysis reveals Levi's strengths in premium pricing and deep promotions, but also identifies areas where competitors are gaining ground.

#### Pricing Snapshot
| Brand | Average Price | Price Range | Promo Frequency (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Levi's | $64.90 | $40-$120 | 30% |
| Lee Korea | $58.50 | $35-$100 | 60% |
| Calvin Klein Korea | $62.20 | $45-$125 | 55% |

Levi's premium pricing strategy is the strongest point, with an average price 10% higher than its competitors. However, this comes at a cost, as the brand's price range is narrower.

#### Promotion Breakdown
| Brand | Average Promo Depth (%) | Total Promotions per Quarter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Levi's | 25% | 120 products (out of 400) |
| Lee Korea | 30% | 150 products (out of 400) |
| Calvin Klein Korea | 28% | 140 products (out of 400) |

Levi's promotion frequency is lower than its competitors, with a total of 120 promotions out of 400 products per quarter. This limits the brand's ability to reach customers and create buzz.

#### Competitive Edge
| Brand | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Levi's | Premium pricing, deep promotions | Narrow price range, low promo frequency |
| Lee Korea | Low prices, high promotion frequency | Limited premium offerings |
| Calvin Klein Korea | Strong mid-range offerings, moderate promo depth | No clear premium positioning |

Levi's strength in premium pricing and deep promotions is a major competitive advantage. However, the brand's narrow price range and low promo frequency leave it vulnerable to competitors.

#### Risks Ahead
Lee Korea's aggressive pricing strategy and high promotion frequency pose a significant risk to Levi's market share. If Levi's fails to adapt its pricing and promotion strategy, it may lose ground to Lee.

#### Action Plan

1. **Increase Premium Offerings**: Expand Levi's premium product line to compete with Calvin Klein Korea.
2. **Boost Promo Frequency**: Increase the number of promotions per quarter by 20% to match Lee Korea's frequency.
3. **Diversify Pricing Strategy**: Introduce mid-range offerings to complement premium and low-price products.
4. **Enhance Customer Engagement**: Implement a loyalty program to reward repeat customers and create brand loyalty.
5. **Monitor Competitor Activity**: Regularly review competitors' pricing and promotion strategies to identify opportunities for improvement.
6. **Analyze Sales Data**: Use sales data to optimize product mix and promotions, ensuring the right products are being promoted at the right times.
7. **Invest in Marketing**: Allocate additional budget to marketing efforts, focusing on digital channels to reach a wider audience.
